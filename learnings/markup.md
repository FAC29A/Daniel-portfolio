The above code demonstrates our use of semantic HTML in order to create a functioning form for our projects page. In addition to this elements such as:
- `<h1>, <h2>, <h3> and more`: were used to show the hierarchy of headings for different sections of the page.
- `<section>`: This was frequently used to show the different sections of the page and also used as a container for them.
- `<input type="text" placeholder="Name">, <input type="email" placeholder="Email">`: Used for the form section of the page, with the displayed attributes for ease of use. 


## 2. Ensure a web page is readable for screen readers

With screen reader users in mind, we used the following to ensure it was readable:
- 

## 3. Ensure our UI has sufficient colour contrast so that everyone can perceive it comfortably

## 4. Use various tools to check that our website meets accessibility criteria

## 5. Use CSS media queries to ensure our content is always presented effectively on screens of different sizes

## 6. Demonstrate a mobile-first approach to building a website

## 7. Use CSS variables to apply repeated colours to HTML elements

## 8. Use CSS Flexbox to style children in a single-direction layout (ie a row or a column)

## 9. Use CSS Grid to style children in two-direction layout

## 10. Ensure our Git commit history tells a coherent story

## 11. Use the appropriate input types in HTML forms for gathering different types of information
